# C# "Console app/Loops" Named Task

## Task Descriptions


### 1) Display the number of elements in the array.

Example:
```
int[] arr = {2,3,6,6}

2 -> 1 

3 -> 1 

6 -> 2 
```
### 2) Console app:

When the app starts, ask the user to enter the size of the array. Then ask if you want to add the item.

If you want to add an element, do it (Yes, yes, Y,y), if you don't want to, stop the program. Ask if you want to add an element each time, regardless of the size of the array.
